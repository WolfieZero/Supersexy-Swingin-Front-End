Supersexy Swingin' Front-End
===============================================================================


Here I will try my best to document my general approach to front-end
development (from a code level) that not only makes it increadably easy to use
and understand but also make it something great to read through.

This document will try to cover most aspects of front-end development looking
at:

- [HTML](https://github.com/WolfieZero/Supersexy-Swingin-Front-End/blob/master/HTML/HTML.md)
- [CSS](https://github.com/WolfieZero/Supersexy-Swingin-Front-End/blob/master/CSS/CSS.md)
    - LESS 
- [JavaScript](https://github.com/WolfieZero/Supersexy-Swingin-Front-End/blob/master/JavaScript/JavaScript.md)
    - jQuery


Why Start This Document
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main purpose of this document was to create a standard for writing code on
the front-end. There are many standards for writing back-end code that helped
communicate what the program is doing, but nothing for the front-end. I thought
this lacked for-sight in that CSS, HTML and JavaScript *may* be easy to read,
but can be quite complex, espcially in this day and age of many web apps not
needing to touch any back-end code.

So SSFE aims to standardize the front-end code so everybody is on the same
wave-length but also provide those not firmilliar with the code an quick
understanding without the need to read any external documentation or training.


What's With the Name?
